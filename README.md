# GitHub Action to publish Docker Images to GitHub Registry

## Usage examples:

### Build and publish Docker Image with a `head` tag for the `develop` branch 

```yaml
  build-and-publish-head:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' # Running this job only for develop branch

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Checking out the repo

    - name: Build and Publish head Docker image
      uses: VaultVulp/gp-docker-action@1.0.1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Provide GITHUB_TOKEN to login into the GitHub Packages
        image-name: my-cool-service # Provide Docker image name
        image-tag: head # Provide Docker image tag
```

### Build and publish Docker Image with a `latest` tag for the `master` branch

```yaml
  build-and-publish-latest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' # Running this job only for master branch

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Checking out the repo

    - name: Build and Publish latest Docker image
      uses: VaultVulp/gp-docker-action@1.0.1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Provide GITHUB_TOKEN to login into the GitHub Packages
        image-name: my-cool-service # Provide only Docker image name, tag will be automatically set to latest
```

### Build and publish Docker Image with a tag equal to a git tag

```yaml
  build-and-publish-tag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') # Running this job only for tags

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build and Publish Tag Docker image
      uses: VaultVulp/gp-docker-action@1.0.1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Provide GITHUB_TOKEN to login into the GitHub Packages
        image-name: my-cool-service # Provide only Docker image name
        extract-git-tag: true # Provide flag to extract Docker image tag from git reference
```

### Build a specific Docker Image with a specific file inside of the context.

```yaml 
  build-specific-dockerfile:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build specific Dockerfile
        uses: velddev/gp-docker-action@v0.3
        with: 
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          image-name: my-cool-service-backend
          docker-file: src/service-backend/Dockerfile
```
